#Consumer Complaints

This is a Python program that is designed to open and interpret a large csv file
containing data consisting of consumer complaints concerning financial instiutions.


##To view the data or run

If you simply want to view the data, you can open the Ipython file in a read only format straight from the Github repository. If you would like to work in the Ipython
file, you will need to install from requirements.txt. You can do this by running
pip install -r 'requirements.txt'. Then you can open ipython notebook from the
terminal by running ipython notebook.

##Results

We were able to collect data from several different angles and create several
different charts. We were able to calculate the most common complaints, the companies
mentioned most often, and the types of products they typically complain about. Finally
we found the average number of complaints by weekday, turns out the worst day to
work at these call centers is Monday!
